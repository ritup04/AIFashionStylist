# 👗 AI Fashion Stylist

An **AI-powered fashion recommendation system** that suggests complementary clothing items and styling ideas based on an uploaded image.  
Built using **DeepFashion2 (Kaggle version)**, **CLIP embeddings**, and **ResNet50 classification**, it provides **occasion-aware**, **color-aware**, and **category-smart** outfit recommendations.

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Automatic Clothing Detection**
- Detects whether an uploaded image is *Topwear*, *Bottomwear*, *Dress*, or *Outerwear* using a trained ResNet50 model.

✅ **Smart Outfit Suggestions**
- Suggests **complementary clothing items** (e.g., Top → Bottomwear, Bottom → Topwear).  
- Uses **CLIP embeddings** and **FAISS similarity search** for top 5 visually similar items.

✅ **Color Analysis**
- Extracts **dominant colors** using K-Means clustering and provides human-readable color names.  
- Generates **color harmony tips** and **contrast-based fashion advice**.

✅ **Occasion-Aware Styling**
- Provides dynamic styling tips based on detected color tone and outfit type — for *Casual, Formal, Party, Streetwear,* or *Festive* occasions.

✅ **Local Execution**
- Works fully offline once the dataset and models are set up on your local machine.
